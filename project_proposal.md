## 3. Problem Statement

Organizations face increasing cybersecurity threats and operational risks that can impact their assets, operations, and reputation. Many organizations, especially small to medium-sized enterprises, lack accessible and systematic tools to:

- Identify and catalog their critical assets
- Map threats and vulnerabilities to these assets
- Quantitatively assess risk levels using standardized methodologies
- Track and manage risk treatment strategies
- Generate professional reports for stakeholders and compliance purposes

Manual risk assessment processes are time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to maintain. There is a need for an intuitive, web-based tool that automates risk calculations, provides visual risk matrices, and enables effective risk treatment tracking.

## 4. Selected Domain
**Risk Management (RM)**

This project focuses on implementing a comprehensive risk management solution following industry-standard frameworks such as ISO 31000 and NIST Risk Management Framework principles.

## 5. Proposed Features

### 5.1 Asset Inventory Module
- Add, edit, and delete organizational assets
- Categorize assets by type (Hardware, Software, Data, Personnel, Facilities)
- Assign asset values and criticality levels
- Search and filter capabilities

### 5.2 Threat/Vulnerability Mapping
- Comprehensive threat library (Malware, Phishing, DDoS, Insider Threats, etc.)
- Vulnerability database linked to assets
- Mapping of threats to vulnerabilities
- Threat-asset relationship tracking

### 5.3 Likelihood × Impact Scoring
- Standardized likelihood scale (1-5: Rare to Almost Certain)
- Standardized impact scale (1-5: Insignificant to Catastrophic)
- Automated risk score calculation (Likelihood × Impact)
- Qualitative risk level assignment

### 5.4 Automated Risk Classification
- Risk matrix visualization (5×5 grid)
- Color-coded risk levels:
  - **Low Risk** (1-6): Green
  - **Medium Risk** (8-12): Yellow
  - **High Risk** (15-25): Red
- Real-time risk level updates

### 5.5 Risk Treatment Tracking Dashboard
- Four treatment strategies: Mitigate, Accept, Transfer, Avoid
- Treatment status tracking (Planned, In Progress, Completed)
- Responsible party assignment
- Treatment effectiveness monitoring

### 5.6 Exportable Final Report
- **PDF Export**: Comprehensive risk assessment report with:
  - Executive summary
  - Asset inventory
  - Risk matrix visualization
  - Detailed risk analysis
  - Treatment recommendations
- **Excel Export**: Data tables for further analysis
- Professional formatting and branding
